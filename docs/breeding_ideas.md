## Breeding Chocobos
* Requires an open area on gras land with visible sky.
* A chocobo pen consists of atleast one nest per chocobo. (built from hay)
* The *Pen* will calculate a breeding score which is affected by:
  * Pen Size: Chocobos like open areas. Big animals need a decent amount of space. Each block of horizontal space will increase the score, up to a maximum.
  * Shelter: The nest inside a pen should grant shelter against monsters and rain.
  * Water: Even chocobos are thirsty at times
  * Food: A small bin filled with vegetables or even meat for the times when the chocobos get hungry
  * Skylight: Even though the nest should be covered, the rest of the area should provide as much natural light as possible. A greenhouse style building will work, but the score will be slighly worse.
* The chocobo will lay eggs in block form. Those can be picked up and placed anywhere, but can only be incubated into a chocobo inside a nest (with a mother chocobo) or inside an incubator(?)
* Different foods can have different effects on breeding?
* Different nest types?

## Chocobo traits and abilities, general stuff

* Chocobos will have different traits:
  * Health: The amount of health a chocobo has
