# Version 0.2 - alpha
- First release
- Chocobos spawn randomly in the overworld (and maybe other dimensions)
- Gysahl Green crop worldgen
- Temporary breeding system: Use two *lovely gysahl greens* to breed two chocobos.
  The offspring will be of a random color. (This system will change in a future release!)
- Chocobos can be tamed using *gysahl green* (15% chance per green used)
- Tamed Chocobos can be ridden using the chocobo saddle
- special saddles with inventories attached are implemented but not fully tested. You might lose your items!
  (Recipes are missing because of this)
- *Traits and Abilities are currently not implemented.*
